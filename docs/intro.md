# Introduction

OResults is an online system providing real-time results of orienteering events. The aim of the system is to simplify the process for the organizing team. 

Providing live split times from radio controls and results takes only a few minutes of preparation with no additional technical knowledge or extensive work. OResults opens up the possibility to provide live results anywhere, at events of any scale from training to world-class, with instant and truly real-time delivery of records.

The OResults User Guide contains all the information you need to know to organise an event with live results in OResults.


 The whole system consists of several key parts. The building stones are our custom devices which transmit punch records over cellular network to our in-house server. Our web app then allows spectators to watch results and organisers to independently manage all necessary aspects of their live results. This all together combines to achieve one goal, to provides simply the best system for live results coverage of any event.
