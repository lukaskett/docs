## Before the event

### Rental

See [OResults/Organize](https://oresults.eu/organize) if you are interested in renting Bluebox units for your event.

### Turn on the units

The units are turned on by a switch located on the side.

:::caution
An external antenna must be attached to the side of each unit before turning it on.
:::

### Charge the units

:::caution
Make sure that the units are properly charged before each event.
:::

The units are charged using the micro USB connector located under the cover on the side of each unit. Use the charger provided in the rental set. In case you want to use your own charger, it must have a nominal output voltage of 5V.

### Check the signal

At the moment, all units are equipped with active SIM cards from T-Mobile CZ.

**Make sure** that there is **any mobile** network **signal** in the places **where** you want to place **your radiocontrol.** The Bluebox units work on the Edge (2G) signal and are able to reliably send punch records even with a weak signal. One or two lines of the signal are enaugh.

:::info
See [Device monitoring](./device-monitoring) for where to check the battery level and the signal strength .
:::

## On the day of the event

### Placement of the units

One unit is capable of receiving punch records from up to 8 SI-SRR stations (see [How to set up a radio control](./radio-control.md))

:::caution
The units must be placed at approximately **the same height as the SI stations** at a **maximum distance of 2 metres** to ensure reliable detection of punch records.
:::

:::tip
The units can be snapped onto a standard SI-BSF7 station holder. You can be placed the units on the same control stand as the SI station or on a separate control stand alongside as it is shown in the pictures.
:::

:::caution
The units are not fully waterproof so if there is a risk of heavy rain they should be covered with a waterproof bag or other cover.
