## Before the event

### Rental

See **[OResults/Organize](https://oresults.eu/organize)** if you are interested in renting Blueboxes for your event.

### Turn on the units

Blueboxes are turned on by a switch located on the side.

:::caution
An external antenna must be attached to the side of each unit before turning it on.
:::

### Charge the Bluebox

The **battery life** of one Bluebox is approximately **20 hours**, so it will last for two standard weekend stages on a single charge.

:::caution
Make sure that the Blueboxes are properly charged before each event.
:::

The Blueboxes are charged using the micro USB connector located under the cover on the side of each unit. Use the charger provided in the rental set. In case you want to use your own charger, it must have a nominal output voltage of 5V.

<!--### Check the signal

At the moment, all Blueboxes are equipped with active SIM cards from T-Mobile CZ and Vodafone CZ.

**Make sure** that there is **any mobile** network **signal** in the places **where** you want to place **your radiocontrol.** The Blueboxes work on the Edge (2G) signal and are able to reliably send punch records even with a weak signal. One or two lines of the signal are enaugh.

:::info
See **[Device monitoring](./device-monitoring)** for where to check the battery level and the signal strength .

## On the day of the event

### Placement of the units

One Bluebox is capable of receiving punch records from up to 8 SI-SRR stations (see **[How to set up a radio control](../tutorials/radio-control.md)**)

:::danger
Blueboxes must be placed at approximately **the same height as the SI stations** at a **maximum distance of 2 metres** to ensure reliable detection of punch records.
:::

:::tip
Blueboxes can be snapped onto a standard SI-BSF8 station holder. You can be placed the units on the same control stand as the SI station or on a separate control stand alongside as it is shown in the pictures.
