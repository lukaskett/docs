# How to use Bluebox units

See the *rental option (link)* if you are interested in renting Bluebox units for your event.

Read these instructions before handling any Bluebox units.

# Before the event

## Turn on the units

**An external antenna must be attached** to the side of each unit before turning it on.

The units are turned on by a switch located on the side.

## Charge the units

**Make sure** that **the units** are properly **charged** before each event. To check the battery level the unit has to be turned on and connected to the network. 

You can check the battery level in the monitoring section of your event (link to the event settings manual).

The units are charged using the micro USB connector located under the cover on the side of each unit. 

Use the charger provided in the rental set. In case you want to use your own charger, it must have a nominal output voltage of 5V.

## Check the signal

**Make sure** that there is **any mobile** network **signal** in the places **where** you want to place **your radiocontrol.** The Bluebox units work on the Edge (2G) signal and are able to reliably send punch records even with a weak signal. One or two lines of the signal are enaugh.

At the moment, all units are equipped with active SIM cards from T-Mobile CZ.

# On the day of the event

## Placement of the units

The units must be placed at approximately the same height as the SI stations at a **maximum distance of 2 metres** to ensure reliable detection of punch records.

The units can be snapped onto a standard SI-BSF7 station holder. 

You can be placed the units on the same control stand as the SI station or on a separate control stand alongside as it is shown in the pictures.

One unit is capable of receiving punch records from up to 8 SI-SRR stations (see *link How to set up radio control*)

## Monitoring

Unit monitoring is available by logging into your OResults administrator account. Here you can monitor whether units are online, battery levels, signal strength, punch records traffic and more.

See *the event setup (link)* for more information about monitoring of the units.
